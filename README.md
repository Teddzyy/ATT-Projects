# My ATT Projects

Welcome to my collection of ATT bot projects! These are the projects I've developed during my time as an ATT bot developer. While not all of them have been uploaded yet, I hope they'll be useful for new and upcoming bot developers in the ATT community.

## About
These projects represent my journey and growth as a bot developer within the ATT community. This is where my coding journey started and I can't thank the ATT developers enough.

## Projects
Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

- **ATT Starter Bot**: In this project, you can find all the code to make your bot, including code examples.
- **Blacklist Bot**: This allows you to disable the joining of griefers and hackers into your ATT server.
- **Tablet Bot**: Moderators can use this for easy moderation purposes inside the ATT server.

Feel free to explore each project in more detail by visiting their respective directories.

## Usage
To use any of these projects, simply clone this repository and input the code into your bot. If any help is needed, you can contact me on Discord. [Name: teddzyy]

## Contributing
I'm no longer actively working on bot development, but if you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Credits
While these projects are made by me, I'd like to thank all the people that helped on my journey. Without these people, I wouldn't be the coder I am today.
